# Thursday_Stick

Visually challenged people face a lot of difficulty during their  locomotion , they find it difficult to figure out the objects/obstacles in front of them. So we have designed an escorting Stick.
Our solution is a partial hardware hack, it uses ResNet model to detect the object in front of the camera.
It can classify 1000 different objects and it reads out the name of the object.
